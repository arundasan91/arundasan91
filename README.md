### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 I’m a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Pittsburg Medical Center (UPMC).
- 🌱 My current work is to progress research in single cell spatial transcriptomic analysis; from cell segmentation, cell typing, to further downstream analysis based on the spatial location of the genes, its expression patterns, pathological insights and much more.
- 🌱 Also, I develop AI algorithms, recently more focused in graph-based algorithms, to identify spatially significant and pathologically relevant gene expression patterns.
- 💬 Ask me about machine learning, deep learning, cloud and distributed computing, and data science.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy photography 📷 and you can find me at [@arun91dasan](https://www.instagram.com/arun91dasan/) on Instagram or [@arun_not_arun](https://twitter.com/arun_not_arun) on Twitter.
- 📄 My publications can be found in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-NrxxMAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
